        <h2>ATM Machine</h2>
        <p>
            In my first year of college, I embarked on creating an ATM Machine using Java, 
            leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project aimed to simulate 
            real-world ATM functionalities, including user authentication, account management, and 
            transaction processing. Employing Java as the primary programming language, I crafted a 
            robust system architecture, encapsulating core functionalities within distinct classes s
            uch as ATM, BankAccount, and User. Through this project, I honed my Java skills, grasped 
            essential OOP concepts, and gained practical experience in software development, setting a 
            solid foundation for future endeavors in the field.</p>

        <h2>Netflix Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>In this project, I utilized a dataset obtained from Kaggle, specifically focusing on Netflix data.
        Leveraging the capabilities of Pandas within the Jupyter Notebook environment, I conducted a 
        comprehensive analysis of the dataset. Through data manipulation and exploration using Pandas, 
        I extracted valuable insights and trends, such as viewership patterns, content distribution, 
        and user preferences.</p>
        <p>
            Additionally, I employed the Power BI tool to create visually engaging representations of the data. 
            Power BI allowed me to generate insightful visualizations, including interactive dashboards and 
            intuitive charts, to present my findings effectively. By combining the analytical power of Pandas 
            with the visualization capabilities of Power BI, I was able to provide a comprehensive overview of the 
            Netflix dataset, enabling stakeholders to gain actionable insights and make informed decisions.

          <h2>Weather Forecasting Website</h2>
          <p>Weather Forecasting Website provides users with up-to-date weather information for their city around
             the world. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website offers a seamless and intuitive user experience.</p>
          <p>
            Upon visiting the website, users are greeted with a clean and modern interface. The homepage displays the current weather
            conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description, for the user's current location.
             Users can also search for weather forecasts in other cities by entering the city name in the search bar.
            Behind the scenes, the website utilizes a weather API to fetch real-time weather data. JavaScript handles the interaction
             with the API, fetching the necessary weather information based on user input and dynamically updating the webpage 
             with the retrieved data.
