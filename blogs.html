            advancements and trends. Attending sessions and keynote speeches by industry experts expanded my knowledge 
            and sparked engaging discussions. Networking with fellow volunteers and attendees further enriched my experience.
            <p>Overall, volunteering at AIST-2022 was an inspiring journey of personal and professional growth, leaving me eager

        <h2>My first Hackathon</h2>
        <p>
            I had a fantastic time at my first 48-hour hackathon, POLLUX 2023, organized by Celestial Biscuit IGDTUW. 
            Our team, 'WeTried,' along with members Samriddhi Tiwari, Riya Ahlawat, and Prakriti Maurya, made it to 
            the top 15 teams in the UX track out of 800+ participants.
        <p>We worked on a UX Case Study for a Web Portal for Reading Technical Blogs and Research Papers by Students of IGDTUW. 
            It was a challenging journey from brainstorming ideas to designing the portal mockup and presenting it through a 
            slide deck. However, with effective communication and perseverance, we delivered a mockup we were proud of. 
            Collaborating with talented and passionate individuals was a great learning experience, and I gained a lot from my 
            team members.Participating in the hackathon reminded me of the power of teamwork and the importance of stepping out 
            of my comfort zone. I'm excited to apply the skills and knowledge I gained to future projects. 
            A big thanks to our mentor, Ms. Pooja Gera, and Celestial Biscuit IGDTUW for this amazing opportunity.</p>
